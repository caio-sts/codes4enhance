# codes4enhance

This repo is a tentative of organize the whole research on methods and metrics in enhancement of medical images. source: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1rtKaxdgp6FbbcJz_3k_WFhydZYPrtnSB?usp=sharing

ASAP I will referencing papers and some repo fonts that I found some codes used in my research. I hope this style of code organization could be better for intuitive use and accelerate implementing points.

Links of datasets to be used:

- Brain Tumor MRI
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/firqaaa/brain-tumor-mri-graph-superpixels

- Breast Tumor Ultrassound
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aryashah2k/breast-ultrasound-images-dataset

After clone the repo, go to workfolder and type in terminal:
python main.py -h

There you will see arguments to apply enhance methods or do data augmentation by applying geometric transformations.
